# Style Guide

## Voice

Probframe entries are written in analytic descriptive prose. The voice is neutral,
structural, and precise. Think academic political science crossed with systems analysis —
not advocacy, not journalism, not self-help.

## Claim labels — required on every factual assertion

| Label | When to use |
| --- | --- |
| `[Observed]` | Documented in a primary or high-quality secondary source |
| `[Inferred]` | Follows logically from observed facts; reasoning stated |
| `[Hypothesis]` | Plausible but unverified; confirming evidence described |

Every sentence that makes a factual claim must carry one label. Structural descriptions
are `[Observed]` when drawn from documented examples.

## Banned language

Do not use:

- Prescriptive framing implying recommendation: *should, must, ought to, best practice*
  (exception: Countermeasures subsection of Analysis outline, which describes documented
  responses neutrally)
- Domain-capture language: *this is fundamentally a political/biological phenomenon*
- Moralizing language used evaluatively: *dangerous, exploitative, corrupt, predatory*

When in doubt: does this describe structure, or evaluate the actor? If the latter, rewrite
in structural terms.

## Conditions of applicability framing

Frame conditions structurally, not as advice:

- Correct: "Pattern X is documented in contexts where information asymmetry is high."
- Incorrect: "Use pattern X when you have an information advantage."

## Mechanism sentence

The **Mechanism in one sentence** field must be ≤ 30 words. It describes what happens
structurally — not why it is significant or who benefits.

## Summary

3–5 sentences. No advocacy. Ends with a structural claim about cross-domain recurrence.
