# Neutrality Pass Prompt (Human Review)

This pass is for human reviewers only. AI agents should not attempt to auto-approve.

---

## Instructions

Read the full `outline.md` for this module. Check for:

1. **Prescriptive framing** — does any sentence imply a recommendation rather than a
   structural description? Rewrite in structural terms.

2. **Domain-capture language** — does any sentence imply one domain owns this pattern?
   Remove or reframe.

3. **Moralizing language** — is any term (*dangerous, exploitative, corrupt, predatory*)
   used evaluatively rather than descriptively? Replace with structural description.

4. **Conditions of applicability framing** — are all conditions framed as documented
   tendencies, not as prescriptions?

5. **Claim labels** — are all factual claims labeled? Are the labels correctly applied?

6. **Tone** — does the voice match the analytic descriptive standard in STYLEGUIDE.md?

For each issue found: quote the offending text, explain the problem, provide a suggested
revision.
