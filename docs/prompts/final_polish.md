This pass is for human reviewers only. AI agents should not attempt to auto-approve.

## Instructions

Read the full `outline.md` for this module. Check for:

1. **Prose quality** — is every sentence grammatically correct and unambiguous?
2. **Mechanism sentence** — is it ≤ 30 words? Does it clearly state the structural logic?
3. **Summary** — is it 3–5 sentences? Does it avoid domain capture and advocacy?
4. **Operational sequence** — are there ≥ 4 steps? Are they written concretely?
5. **Instantiations** — do they span ≥ 2 domains? Are they specific, real cases?
6. **Analysis outline** — are all 6 parts present and substantive?
7. **Sources** — are all 4 citation fields present for every source?

For each issue: quote the text, describe the problem, provide a corrected version.

## Sign-off

When satisfied, note: `Final polish: approved — [your name] — [YYYY-MM-DD]`
