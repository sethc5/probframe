# Glossary

Shared vocabulary for probframe entries and documentation. All authors use these terms
as defined here.

---

**Actor** — Any agent (individual, institution, organism, system) capable of taking
actions that affect other actors or the environment.

**Chokepoint** — A position in a network or process through which a disproportionate
share of flows (information, resources, decisions) must pass.

**Claim label** — One of three markers (`[Observed]`, `[Inferred]`, `[Hypothesis]`)
required on every factual assertion in an entry.

**Degrades into** — The pattern or failure mode that results when a pattern's enabling
conditions fail. Captured in the `Degrades into` cross-reference field.

**Deploying actor** — The actor who activates and benefits from a pattern. Distinct from
the target actor and enabling actors.

**Domain** — A field of practice or study (political, biological, economic, legal,
military, organizational, ecological) from which instantiations are drawn.

**Enabling condition** — A structural condition documented as present when the pattern
operates effectively.

**Disabling condition** — A structural condition documented as causing the pattern to fail
or degrade when present.

**Instantiation** — A specific, documented real-world case in which a pattern is observed.
Not a hypothetical or fictional example.

**Lifecycle** — The sequence of statuses a module passes through: `empty → scaffolded →
draft → sourced → reviewed → published`.

**Modframe instance** — A specific Modframe module ID that documents the pattern in the
US federal power context. Recorded in the `Modframe instances` metadata field.

**Pattern** — A recurring structural logic — a relationship structure between actors and
constraints — that appears across domains.

**Section** — A fuzzy navigation cluster grouping patterns by primary relationship
structure. Not a hard category.

**Status** — The current lifecycle stage of a module, recorded in `README.md`.

**Target actor** — The actor against whom a pattern is deployed. Distinct from deploying
actor.

**Veto point** — A structural position from which an actor can block or reverse an
outcome.
