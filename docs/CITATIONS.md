# Citation Format and Source Hierarchy

## Required format

Every entry in **Suggested sources** must include all four fields:

```
- [Full document title]. [Author / Issuing body], [Year or Month Year]. [URL or identifier].
```

Examples:

```
- The Strategy of Conflict. Thomas C. Schelling, Harvard University Press, 1960. ISBN 978-0674840317.
- Regulatory Capture. George Stigler, Bell Journal of Economics, 1971. https://doi.org/10.2307/3003160.
- Federal Election Campaign Act, as amended. 52 U.S.C. §§ 30101–30145. https://uscode.house.gov/
```

## Source hierarchy

Prefer earlier tiers:

1. **Primary:** Peer-reviewed academic work with original data or theory; statutes,
   regulations, court opinions, agency records; GAO/OIG/CRS reports; official datasets.
2. **Secondary:** Reputable primary-source journalism (ProPublica, Reuters, AP, Bloomberg);
   established reference works and textbooks with traceable citations.
3. **Avoid:** Opinion pieces, advocacy organization reports without tier-1 sourcing,
   Wikipedia, paywalled sources without a free version noted.

## Cross-domain sourcing

Cross-domain sourcing is expected and encouraged. An entry on coalition assembly may cite
Riker (political science), Axelrod (game theory), and a GAO report on congressional
logrolling — this is the intended pattern.

## Invented citations

Inventing citations is a critical defect. If you cannot find a real source, downgrade the
claim from `[Observed]` to `[Inferred]` or `[Hypothesis]` and note the downgrade.
