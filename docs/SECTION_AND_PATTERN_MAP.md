## Section 01 — Adversarial Patterns

*Zero-sum or negative-sum contexts with an active opponent. The pattern's primary logic
is operating against a resisting, adaptive adversary.*

| # | Pattern | Core logic |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 001 | Direct Displacement | Remove the opponent from a position rather than working around them |
| 002 | Attrition and Resource Exhaustion | Outlast the opponent by depleting their capacity to resist |
| 003 | Encirclement and Isolation | Cut the opponent off from allies, resources, or audiences |
| 004 | Divide and Fragment | Split opponent coalitions so they cannot mount unified resistance |
| 005 | Preemptive Positioning | Occupy key terrain before the opponent can contest it |
| 006 | Delegitimization | Attack the opponent's claim to authority rather than their capacity |
| 007 | Bait and Commitment Trapping | Induce the opponent to commit to a position that limits their options |
| 008 | Proxy and Surrogate Deployment | Achieve adversarial objectives through actors one step removed |

---

## Section 02 — Cooperative and Coalition Patterns

*Positive-sum or variable-sum contexts requiring coordination among actors with
partly-aligned, partly-divergent interests.*

| # | Pattern | Core logic |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 009 | Coalition Assembly | Recruit sufficient actors to achieve a shared objective |
| 010 | Minimum Winning Coalition | Assemble the smallest coalition sufficient to win, maximizing each member's share |
| 011 | Logrolling and Side-Payment | Exchange support across separate issues to reach mutually acceptable outcomes |
| 012 | Preference Aggregation | Combine divergent preferences into a collective decision through structured procedures |
| 013 | Credible Commitment Mechanisms | Make promises binding through structural constraints on defection |
| 014 | Defection Prevention and Enforcement | Deter coalition members from exiting once committed |
| 015 | Collective Action Bootstrapping | Overcome the initial coordination problem before mutual benefit becomes visible |

---

## Section 03 — Procedural and Sequencing Patterns

*Path-dependent, rule-governed, or timing-sensitive contexts where the order of moves
determines the outcome independently of relative power.*

| # | Pattern | Core logic |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 016 | Procedural Delay | Use the rules of the process to slow or stop an outcome |
| 017 | Threshold and Trigger Design | Set the conditions under which a process activates or escalates |
| 018 | Irreversibility Locking | Make a decision or outcome difficult or impossible to reverse |
| 019 | Sequential Commitment | Use early commitments to constrain later choices for self or others |
| 020 | First-Mover Advantage Capture | Exploit the structural advantages of acting before others can respond |
| 021 | Process Capture and Rule-Setting | Control the rules of the process rather than competing within them |
| 022 | Precedent Creation | Establish a prior decision as binding on future similar decisions |
| 023 | Deadline Leverage | Use time pressure asymmetrically to extract concessions |

---

## Section 04 — Information and Signaling Patterns

| 027 | Strategic Ambiguity | Preserve optionality by declining to commit to a clear position |
| 028 | Disclosure Timing | Control when information enters the environment to shape interpretation |
| 029 | Narrative Framing and Definition Control | Set the terms in which a situation is interpreted before others can frame it differently |
| 030 | Transparency as Weapon | Use forced disclosure to constrain, expose, or delegitimize opponents |

---

## Section 05 — Constraint and Boundary Patterns

*Operating within, around, or by reshaping binding constraints. The pattern's primary
logic is the relationship between actors and the rules or limits that govern them.*

| # | Pattern | Core logic |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 031 | Constraint Mapping | Systematically identify the binding limits before committing to a strategy |
| 032 | Boundary Arbitrage | Exploit gaps between overlapping or inconsistent rule systems |
| 033 | Constraint Tightening on Opponents | Introduce new rules, costs, or requirements that bind opponents more than self |
| 034 | Veto Point Installation | Create structural positions from which future actions can be blocked |
| 035 | Safe Harbor Creation | Establish protected zones where normal constraints do not apply |
| 036 | Jurisdiction Shopping | Select the rule system most favorable to one's position |
| 037 | Definitional Capture | Control how key terms are officially defined to shape what rules apply |

---

## Section 06 — Resource and Positioning Patterns

*Scarcity, leverage, and positional advantage. The pattern's primary logic is the
relationship between actors and the resources, positions, or flows they depend on.*

| # | Pattern | Core logic |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 038 | Resource Concentration | Accumulate resources faster or more completely than competitors or opponents |
| 039 | Chokepoint Control | Position at a bottleneck through which others must pass |
| 040 | Dependency Creation | Make others reliant on your resources, decisions, or access |
| 041 | Option Preservation | Maintain flexibility by avoiding commitments that close off future choices |
| 042 | Sunk Cost Leveraging | Use prior investments to extract continued commitment from others |
| 043 | Surplus Extraction | Capture a disproportionate share of value from a cooperative arrangement |
| 044 | Access Economics | Control the terms under which actors can enter a market, system, or process |

---

## Section 07 — Hierarchical and Delegative Patterns

*Principal-agent structures, authority, and accountability gaps. The pattern's primary
logic is the relationship between those who hold authority and those who exercise it.*

| # | Pattern | Core logic |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 045 | Delegation with Deniability | Transfer action to agents while retaining benefit and insulating from accountability |
| 046 | Mandate Expansion | Incrementally extend authority beyond its original charter |
| 047 | Oversight Capture | Gain influence over the body that monitors your behavior |
| 048 | Accountability Diffusion | Distribute responsibility across actors so that no single actor is accountable for outcomes |
| 049 | Succession and Continuity Control | Shape who holds authority after a transition |
| 050 | Gatekeeping and Filter Installation | Control the flow of information, people, or resources through a hierarchical choke |
| 051 | Escalation Path Design | Structure how conflicts or decisions move up or across hierarchical levels |

---

## Section 08 — Evolutionary and Iterative Patterns

*Selection, variation, feedback loops, and adaptive strategies. The pattern's primary
logic is change over repeated cycles rather than single-move optimization.*

| # | Pattern | Core logic |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 052 | Variation and Selection | Generate diverse approaches and allow differential success to amplify winners |
| 053 | Feedback Loop Construction | Create mechanisms that cause outputs to reinforce or amplify their own inputs |

| 057 | Incremental Normalization | Make a change acceptable by introducing it in steps too small to trigger resistance |
| 058 | Error Correction Architecture | Build systems with feedback mechanisms that identify and compensate for deviations |

---

## Section 09 — Crisis and Exception Patterns

*Urgency, emergency authority, and normal-process suspension. The pattern's primary logic
is the relationship between normal operating constraints and the conditions under which
they are suspended.*

| # | Pattern | Core logic |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 059 | Emergency Declaration | Formally invoke a crisis classification to access expanded authority |
| 060 | Crisis Exploitation | Use a genuine disruption to achieve objectives that normal conditions would not permit |
| 061 | Manufactured Urgency | Create or amplify the perception of crisis to justify exception powers |

| 064 | Crisis Coordination Structures | Build cross-boundary authority mechanisms that activate only under defined emergency conditions |

---

## Section 10 — Analogical and Transfer Patterns

*Cross-domain pattern recognition, reuse, and translation. The pattern's primary logic
is the movement of structural insight between domains.*

| # | Pattern | Core logic |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 065 | Direct Structural Analogy | Apply a solution from one domain to a structurally similar problem in another |
| 066 | Mechanism Transfer | Import a specific causal mechanism from one domain without importing its full context |
| 067 | Model Importing | Adopt an entire framework or system from another domain as a template |
| 068 | Anti-Pattern Recognition | Identify a structural failure mode by analogy to documented failures in other domains |
| 069 | Domain Translation Failures | How analogical transfer fails — mismatched assumptions, missing enabling conditions, context collapse |

---

## Section 11 — Meta-Strategies

*Strategies about strategies. The pattern's primary logic is operating on the conditions
of problem-solving itself — legitimacy, rule-setting, second-order effects, and the
architecture of future contests.*

| # | Pattern | Core logic |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 070 | Legitimacy Construction | Build the social and institutional recognition that allows authority to be exercised without constant enforcement |
| 071 | Rule-Setter Capture | Gain influence over who defines the rules of the game |
| 072 | Norm Erosion | Weaken informal constraints through incremental boundary-testing |
| 073 | Overhang and Future Option Denial | Take actions now that constrain the future choices of others |
| 074 | Infrastructure Capture | Gain control over the platforms, systems, or organizations through which others operate |
