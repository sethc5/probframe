# Model Importing

**Summary:** <!-- 3–5 sentences: what this pattern is, why it recurs across domains, what structural feature makes it recognizable. Descriptive voice — no advocacy. -->

**Mechanism in one sentence:** <!-- ≤ 30 words. How the pattern operates at its core. -->

### Actors and deployment context

<!-- Who deploys this pattern, against what, and in what structural position. List deploying actor, target actor, and any enabling actors. Each bullet: name → role → incentive → constraint. Claim label required. -->

- **[Deploying actor type]** — [role]; incentive: [what drives deployment]; constraint: [what limits deployment]. [claim label]
- **[Target actor type]** — [role]; response options: [what target can do]; constraint: [what limits response]. [claim label]

### Operational sequence

<!-- Minimum 4 steps. Each step: name → concrete action → who does it → what changes in the environment. Claim label required. -->

- **Step 1 — [Phase name]:** [action]. [claim label]
- **Step 2 — [Phase name]:** [action]. [claim label]
- **Step 3 — [Phase name]:** [action]. [claim label]
- **Step 4 — [Outcome phase]:** [how advantage is locked in or extended]. [claim label]

### Where leverage concentrates

<!-- Chokepoints, bottlenecks, veto points. Where in the sequence does the deploying actor gain disproportionate control? Claim label required. -->

- **Chokepoints:** [claim label]
- **Bottlenecks:** [claim label]
- **Veto points:** [claim label]

### Conditions of applicability

**Enabling conditions** — documented when the pattern operates:

- [Structural condition 1]. [claim label]
- [Structural condition 2]. [claim label]
- [Structural condition 3]. [claim label]

**Disabling conditions** — documented when the pattern fails or degrades:

- [Condition under which the pattern collapses or reverses]. [claim label]
- [Second disabling condition]. [claim label]

### Common failure modes

<!-- How and why the pattern breaks down. Name the failure mode, label the claim, describe what triggers failure and what the pattern degrades into. -->

- **[Mode name]** — [claim label] — [explanation; what it degrades into]
- **[Mode name]** — [claim label] — [explanation]

### What evidence would prove/disprove key claims

<!-- Dataset, case record, or cross-domain comparison that would confirm or refute the central mechanism claim. What would a contrary finding look like? -->

- [Confirming evidence type]
- [Disconfirming evidence type]
- [Comparative test across domains]

### Instantiations

<!-- Cross-domain documented examples. Domain → specific case → source → which aspect of the pattern it illustrates. Minimum 2 domains. -->

- **[Domain A]:** [specific case]. [claim label — source]
- **[Domain B]:** [specific case]. [claim label — source]
- **[Domain C]:** [specific case]. [claim label — source]

### Analysis outline (6 parts)

1. **Pattern** — [what this pattern is and what relationship structure it operates on]
2. **Mechanism** — [why the pattern works — the structural logic]
3. **Instantiation** — [a specific, real cross-domain case study — name it and name the domain]
4. **Evidence** — [primary sources or data to show across domains]
5. **Countermeasures** — [≥ 2 documented structural responses or reforms that have altered pattern outcomes — describe neutrally]
6. **Takeaway** — [the structural insight a reader should retain]
